# PlumberTutorial

`plumber` is an R package that converts your existing R code to a web API using a handful of special one-line comments.

This repository is a tutorial to start with this R package. A lot of examples and explanations come from [the official documentation](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/) and [this article](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/07/23/rest-apis-and-plumber/) from R view.

This repository also includes an example API `plumber.R`, including all the cases study from the tutorial. This API is accessible from the lab network at the address: http://192.168.101.44:8080 (you can try by accessing to this address from your web browser: http://192.168.101.44:8080/\_\_swagger\_\_/)
